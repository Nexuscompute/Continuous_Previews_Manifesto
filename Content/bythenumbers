What CP looks like-

By the Numbers:

1. New feature / topic / bug fix is designed and ticketed
2. Development Team member is assigned the ticket and creates a git topic branch and begins development
3. When ready for review the Development Team member opens a Merge Request
4. The Merge Request initiates a series of automations that results in a new Preview
5. The Preview is available at a shareable, secure URL
6. Assigned QA / Approver / Reviewer tests the feature and provides feedback directly to the assigned Developer.  
7. The Development Team member commits the relevant changes which are automatically updated at the Preview URL.  
8.  This iterative cycle between the Developer and the Feature Approver continues cyclically until the feature is approved.
9.  Once the feature is approved the feature branch is merged.
10. When the feature branch is merged the dynamic hosting environment and all components are retrograded.
