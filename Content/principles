The 11 Principles of CP 

1. Significantly Easier to Fix issues Pre-merge vice Post-merge

2. Bring QA into the Development Process (CP = Continuous Collaboration between Devolopment and Product)

3. Confirm Functionality Prior to Integration

4. Isolated Feature Testing (Separation of Concerns) over batch testing

5. Tight integration between Ticketing, Repositories, Infrastructure

6. No additional burdens on the Development Team7.  Limit Context Switching

8. Reliance on Automation

9. Reduce reliance on Critical Single Points of Failure (i.e. persistent QA environment)

10. Empower Developers with Feature-level Test Environments

11. Support for Full-stack (Front ends, Back Ends, Microservices, APIs, backing services . . .)
